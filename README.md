# Pacman-Game

The provided code is a C++ implementation of a Pac-Man game with a randomly moving ghost. It utilizes a 2D array to represent the game board, where 'o' represents pellets, '#' represents walls, and different characters represent Pac-Man and the ghost. The player can move Pac-Man using 'w', 's', 'a', and 'd' keys. The ghost moves randomly but detects Pac-Man's presence. The game ends when Pac-Man collects all pellets or is caught by the ghost. The score increases with each pellet collected. The code includes functions to count pellets and print the maze.
